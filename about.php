					<h3>Anthony Mulongo</h3>
					<h4>Founder</h4>
					<p>Anthony Mulongo was selected by the Kenyan government as one of the brightest
					students of his generation and fast-tracked into an intensive journalism course
					where a lucrative career in broadcasting beckoned.</p>
					<p>His plans and his heart changed when he encountered a group of children surviving
					on the streets of Mombasa.</p>
					<p>One 6-year old girl, Gift, had lost her mother to AIDS and, with her 10-month old
					brother strapped to her back, scavenged the dumps for food – not realizing that the
					little one was already dead. Anthony took her into his home, enrolled her in school,
					and raised her as his own.</p>
					<p>More girls followed and this gave birth to our first home known as Mudzini Kwetu.
					After sacrificing his career as a journalist Anthony was recruited to open the
					International Justice Mission (IJM) office in Kenya, before devoting himself fulltime
					to Mudzini Kwetu.</p>
					<p>He has since founded a network uniting child welfare organizations in coastal
					Kenya. Anthony manages our housing and schooling operations in Kenya, casts the
					vision, leads our staff teams, and is involved in fundraising and sharing our story
					with international audiences.</p>

					<h3>Thomas Keown</h3>
					<h4>Founder</h4>
					<p>Former columnist and media professional Thomas Keown was a self-confessed
					skeptic about the value of supporting orphanages. His worldview was rocked by a
					trip to Kenya where he met Anthony Mulongo who introduced him to children living
					on the streets of Mombasa.</p>
					<p>Thomas realized it wasn’t just about building homes or schools but about raising
					a generation of principled, educated leaders to break the cycle of poverty and
					corruption that afflicted so many for so long.</p>
					<p>That challenge captured his imagination and resonated with his Christian faith. As a
					result he wrote an article about his Kenyan experience for newspapers in New York,
					Boston and Philadelphia, which generated such an overwhelming response that he
					launched One Home Many Hopes which evolved into Many Hopes.</p>
					<p>Thomas serves as Executive Director internationally championing our work and
					vision and overseeing all areas of fundraising, volunteering and operations.
					A graduate of Queens’ University in Belfast, the Northern Irishman travels
					extensively to speak across the UK and US.</p>
