			<h1>Mudzini Kwetu</h1>
			<p class="bigger">Mudzini Kwetu is our girl's home in Mtwapa, Kenya. It was built to make sure the girls feel like what they are: members of a family, not orphans in an institution. Each floor of the main house has four bedrooms, a living room, kitchen, house-mother and family of mixed-age children. This is their home and their family until they choose to leave and make their own lives.</p>

			<h3 class="development">A New School</h3>
			<p>Our first school will have a capacity of 720, plus pre-school, and a high-quality curriculum that will take from the best in the US, UK and Kenya. A record of academic excellence will attract fee-paying students to ensure the school ultimately funds itself, so we can build the next one. The impact the girls in our home will have will be magnified many times over if they graduate from a quality school with a network of hundreds who share their desire for justice.</p>

			<h3 class="development">Community Water Project</h3>
			<p>Walking for miles to get water keeps children home from school. Drinking dirty water makes people around us sick and keeps children home from school. Taps from our well make sure families  stay healthy and children get to school.</p>

			<h3 class="development">Maternal Health Center</h3>
			<p>Women die in childbirth, leaving children behind. Older siblings care for the younger, and nobody gets to school. Our planned health center will provide pre- and post-natal care for mothers and vaccines for children, making sure parents stay healthy and children get to school. </p>
